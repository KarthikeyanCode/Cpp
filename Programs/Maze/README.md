# Maze 

- This program takes the maze map as input and traverses through the maze from
entrance to exit 

- The maximum x and y dimensions of the map are 50 each. This is due to memory constraints and also to clearly observe the output.

- The traversed path to output will be shown neatly at the end of the program.
