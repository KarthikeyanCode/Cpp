# Page Replacement Algorithms

- Page Replacement Algorithms can be used to increase the accuracy of cache hit and reduce cache miss. Cache miss generally happens when the physical address corresponding to the virtual address of the page cannot be indexed in the cache.

- In this case the cache loads the required memory from RAM or secondary storage devices like SSD or HDD. 

- This repository contains Cpp program implementations for page replacement algorithms.
